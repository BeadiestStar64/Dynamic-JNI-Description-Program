## Overview
I was interested in JNI, but when I looked into it, I couldn't find much information.  
So I decided to research everything I could find about JNI and make it available to everyone on GitHub.  
Now there is no need to fear JNI!

## What is JNI?
JNA (Java Native Interface) can use C/C++ code by dynamic library.  
But, **this explanation does not accurate.**  
Please check [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface), or you could search by Google.
